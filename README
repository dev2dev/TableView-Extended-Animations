UITableViewExtendedAnimations category allows to perform new animations,
such as moving cells, exchanging cells, and making transitions from one
cell to another.
There are three new methods on UITableView:
-moveRowAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:
-transitRowAtIndexPath:toRowIndexPath:
-exchangeRowAtIndexPath:withRowAtIndexPath:

This was done using a regular Objective-C category. 

To perform such animations UITableViewDelegate protocol was extended.
There are a couple of new methods you have to implement to make these
animations possible. Take a look at example project to see that methods.
